Project Work in Master of Technology (M.Tech)	:
Topic	: Studies on emerging IRNSS as a component of Hybrid GNSS Operation.
Abstract	: Indian Regional Satellite Navigation System (IRNSS), developed by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) is designed to provide PVT services in and around India. Since end of April, 2016, all the planned 07 satellites (03 GEOs and 04 IGSOs) are in orbit transmitting signals in L and S-band those can be used for PVT solutions. This study discusses on initial results on the capabilities of IRNSS in standalone and hybrid mode of operation with GPS, and advantages of IRNSS utilizing data collected from eastern part of India. This study also covers the graphic user interfaces of RTKLIB application programs over multi-GNSS (GPS, GLONASS and GALILEO) raw data.
Duration				: One year
Project Guide	: Dr. Anindya Bose, Scientific Officer (Selection Grade), The University of Burdwan.

Project Work in Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech)	:
Topic	: Stereo Preamplifier for car stereo application.
Abstract	: A preamplifier is an electronic amplifier that converts a weak electrical signal into an output signal strong enough to be noise tolerant and strong enough for further processing. Without this, the final signal would be noisy or distorted. They are typically used to amplify signals from analog sensors. Because of this, the preamplifier is often placed close to the sensor to reduce the effects of noise and interference. An ideal preamplifier will be linear, have high input impedance and low output impedance. It is used to boost the signal strength to drive the cable to the main instrument without significantly degrading the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
